# CCFA-Healthcare-Access

Over the course of 4 years, I worked on the CCFA Survey for Healthcare Access collecting, organizing, and analyzing a small dataset of about 4000 records. I began working on this project while taking a class in computer science in my undergrad at the University of Chicago and decided to apply what I knew to streamline the analysis process (since excel can be cumbersome when analyzing datasets).

Originally starting with Racket, an offshoot of Scheme, (which was taught during my first, and the only, class I took) I began to explore the data.

I was later asked to help with queries in our Translational Core's Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW) which requires SQL. At that point, I realized SQL was a much better method in which to manipulate and explore data.

Later, after exploring machine learning, Python became my preferred tool of use as cleaning, querying, analyzing, and visualizing data can be done in a single pipeline.

This repository should not serve as a program for someone else; rather, it serves as a record of my own work.
